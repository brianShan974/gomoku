# Gomoku

Gomoku is a game of 2 players.
One of the players uses black pieces and the other uses white pieces.
Starting from the black player, the players alternately place a piece of their own color onto the board.
The goal is to have 5 pieces of your own color connected in a row, either horizontally, vertically or diagnoally.

This is my implementation of that game in rust, and it is still under development.
